                <h3 class="abouth3">What is this?</h3>
                <span>The Rick and Morty API is a REST(ish) and GraphQL API based on the television show <a class="ablink" href="https://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty">Rick and Morty</a>. You will have access to about hundreds of characters, images, locations and episodes. The Rick and Morty API is filled with canonical information as seen on the TV show.</span>
